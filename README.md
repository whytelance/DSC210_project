## Dimensionality Reduction PCA verse Tucker 
We did dimensionality reduction on the Olivetti Faces dataset using PCA and Tucker decomposition and visual comparison of original, PCA-reconstructed, and Tucker-reconstructed images.

### Dependency
torch == 2.4.1
torchvision == 0.19.1
matplotlib == 3.5.1
pandas == 1.5.3
tensorly ==  0.9.0
scipy == 1.10.1
scikit-learn == 1.0.2
numpy == 1.24.3
python version 3.8

### How to run 
Since we perform our experiment in jupyter notebook, just run each code block in order. 


## Tensor in NLP
We built an deep learning model for text classification of Twitter emotion classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadyasingh55/twitter-emotion-classification-dataset/code) Dataset from Kaggle. The datset contain sentances in English and label are the emotion of the sentance. There are 6 different emotion labels.

## Tensor in Computer vision
We built an deep learning model for images classification of MNIST Dataset(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology). The datset contain a large collection of handwritten digits from 1 to 10. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
